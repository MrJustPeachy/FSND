Hello and welcome to my first project in the full stack nanodegree course.

In order to run the program you must download this folder and run "entertainment_center.py". 
This calls "fresh_tomatoes.py" and dynamically creates the webpage.

If you want to add/edit/remove movies from the website, go to "entertainment_center.py" and you can change the movie
variables and the associated list. These changes will show up once you re-compile the file and your changes will be 
displayed.
