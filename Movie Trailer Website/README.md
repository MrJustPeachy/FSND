Hello and welcome to my first project in the full stack nanodegree course.

You must download Python 2.7.14 for this project to run.

### How to run the code: ###
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open your terminal to the directory that the files are located in.
3. Once you're in the correct directory, type "python entertainment_center.py". This compiles the python file that will 
create the movie trailer website.
4. After the file has run, a file named "fresh_tomatoes.html" should appear in the same directory as the other files
and a webpage should show run in your browser too.

If you want to add/edit/remove movies from the website, go to "entertainment_center.py" and you can change the movie
variables and the associated list. These changes will show up once you re-compile the file and your changes will be 
displayed.
